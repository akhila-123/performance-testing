Performance Test Plan

Objective: Validate that the checkout flow performs well under expected and peak user loads.

Test Environment:

Application URL: [Insert URL]

Server Details: [Insert server spec, location, DB, etc.]

Tool: [e.g., Apache JMeter v5.5]

Assumptions:

Average user session time: 5–10 minutes

Peak users: 1000 concurrent users

Data will be reused for virtual users (with parameterization)

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Response Time: Should be < 2s for 95% of requests

Throughput: Number of requests handled per second

Error Rate: Should be < 1%

Resource Usage: CPU < 80%, Memory < 75%

Test Scenarios:

Load Testing

Stress Testing

Spike Testing

Soak Testing

Risks & Mitigation:

Risk: API server throttling → Mitigation: Gradual ramp-up, staggered user load

Risk: Test data depletion → Mitigation: Data parameterization, data pool reset scripts

Test Exit Criteria:

All KPIs are met under expected loads

No critical failures or SLA breaches
