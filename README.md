# ðŸ”§ Performance Testing for an E-Commerce Checkout Flow
Objective:
Evaluate and analyze the performance of an e-commerce web application's checkout process under various load conditions.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
1. Test Scope
Focus on the following user flow:

User logs in.

Adds item(s) to cart.

Proceeds to checkout.

Completes the purchase.

2. Environment Setup
Use a sample e-commerce site (you can use an open-source project like Magento Demo, Dummy JSON API, or your own local instance).

Tools you may use: JMeter, Gatling, k6, LoadRunner, or Locust.

ðŸ§ª Tasks to Perform:
A. Create Performance Test Plan
Define test objectives.

Identify system bottlenecks.

Define KPIs: Response time, throughput, error rate, etc.

B. Design Test Scenarios
Load Testing: 100, 500, 1000 users.

Stress Testing: Gradually increase users until system failure.

Soak Testing: Simulate 100 users over 2 hours.

Spike Testing: Abrupt jump from 100 to 1000 users.

C. Implement Test Scripts
Use your chosen tool to simulate user behavior for each part of the checkout flow.

Parameterize inputs (user login, item selection).

Include assertions for expected response codes and time limits.

D. Execute Tests
Run tests in a controlled environment.

Record results (CPU, Memory, Response Time, Errors).

E. Analyze and Report
Provide graphs (response time vs load, error rate, throughput).

Identify system bottlenecks (e.g., DB queries, API delays).

Provide recommendations for improvement.

ðŸ“„ Deliverables
Test Plan Document â€“ Scope, tools, and scenarios.

Scripts â€“ Source files used in performance tests.

Test Report â€“ Detailed results, graphs, bottleneck analysis, recommendations.

Presentation (Optional) â€“ A 5â€“10 slide summary for stakeholders.

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Challenges
Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipeline.

Use cloud-based tools like BlazeMeter or AWS CloudWatch.

Test API rate-limiting behavior.
